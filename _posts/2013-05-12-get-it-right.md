The software program that I think gets it right, business acumen aside, is [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com). I think there are three areas that they get right.

1. They are device agnostic. I think the fact that they are striving to be on every device that a potential user might be on is great. I think they really understand that a user wants it, when they want it, where they want it.

2. They take care of the grunt work. I think a great program makes me not have to think. Other than downloading, there is never any configuration, never any hassles. Also, I constantly amazed that even through the movie is streaming, it never feels like it.

3. Iâ€™m awesome. Because of item one and two, as a user, I feel great. For me it just works, in that way, Netflix becomes transparent, and achieves my goal, which is to watch the past seasons of Breaking Bad

I think my runner up would probably be Dropbox for almost exactly the same reasons.
